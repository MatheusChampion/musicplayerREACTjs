# Music Player made with ReactJs Framework

A small project with ReactJs

The music player grab music from the background and communicate with the front end. 

It was a good project to understand backend communication and get familiar with React framwork. 

Great project to practice. 


P.S. I'll keep making it better with time as practice.
